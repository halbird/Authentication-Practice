# Authentication-Practice
Sample authentication using express, mongoose, and passport

Exercise from Colt Steele's "The Web Developer Bootcamp" on Udemy. Nothing fancy, just practice setting up user authentication with register, login, and logout. 

A user must be logged in to access the "secret page" at /secret. When a user registers, they are added to the database with a hashed password.

Uses: Express, Mongoose/MongoDB, Body Parser, EJS, Passport, Passport Local, and Passport Local Mongoose.
